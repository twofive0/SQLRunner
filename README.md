# SQLRunner - A lightweight swiss army knife SQL Management program for Windows

**This version of SQLRunner is feature-complete, but no longer maintained**

A C# version of this project SQLRunner2 is currently a work in progress that will replace this version.

Over the years, SQLRunner has been my go-to project to learn languages and experiment with whatever technology I was interested in at the time.  I've written different versions of this application in VB.Net, Object Pascal and Java - now in C#.  I've also used this application professionally for a variety of reasons - mostly to assist in database conversions/migrations.

## Purpose

SQLRunner is a simple, lightweight SQL query tool that also allows simple transfer of information among supported databases and import/export from flat files.

The finished version should support the following formats:
* SQL Server
* SQL Server Compact
* SQLite
* Excel (xlsx)
* CSV/Delimited
* XML
